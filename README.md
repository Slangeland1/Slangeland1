<b>Let us work together on an exciting ML project!  For more about me, see my bio below.  I'm for hire for freelancing, consulting, and full-time jobs.  You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanielangeland/).</b>

## Bio
I’m a Senior Data Scientist who translates data into business insights by leading, managing, and executing all facets of data science projects.  I’m passionate about machine learning and have built models for segmentation, NLP, propensity modeling, survival analysis, time series forecasting, and more.  In addition to my technical skills, I’m proficient in uniting stakeholders from cross-functional teams around a common goal to deploy models that solve the business problem at hand.  

I have 6 years of data science experience in consulting, consumer products, HR analytics, insurance, media & entertainment, and government research.  Before graduating, top of my class, with a master’s degree from Columbia University, I worked with clients and led multifaceted internal audits in the investments space for 2 years.

### Work samples
Like most professionals, the work I've done in industry is protected by NDAs, so I can't share it here.  However, I'm working on personal project on Large Language Models now, so stay tuned for a new repo coming soon 🚨.

⏮️ ⏰ If you'd like to rewind back to my earliest days of coding, you can check out my repos for my [Master's Thesis at Columbia University](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Investment_Advice_from_the_FOMC) and select projects I completed during my [early career or during graduate school at Columbia](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects).
