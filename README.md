# Welcome to my GitHub, I'm Stephanie 👋

I'm a <b><ins>Data Scientist</ins></b>, who is passionate about machine learning 🤖 and scuba diving 🤿.  When I'm not underwater, my favorite days are spent coding 👩‍💻.
<br>
<b>Let's work together on an exciting ML project!  I'm for hire for freelancing, consulting, and full-time jobs.  You can reach me by messaging me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanielangeland/).</b>

## Bio
I translate data into business insights by leading, managing, and executing all facets of data science projects.  I’m passionate about machine learning and have built models for segmentation, NLP, propensity modeling, survival analysis, time series forecasting, and more.  In addition to my technical skills, I’m proficient in uniting stakeholders from cross-functional teams around a common goal to deploy models that solve the business problem at hand.  

I have 6 years of data science experience in consulting, consumer products, HR analytics, insurance, media & entertainment, and government research.  Before graduating, top of my class, with a master’s degree from Columbia University, I worked with clients and led multifaceted internal audits in the investments space for 2 years.

## Work samples
I completed my master's degree in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS), with a focus in Data Science, at Columbia University in 2018.  Ever since, I've been a Data Scientist in industry, so all of my post-graduate work is protected by corporate NDAs and can't be displayed here.  However, I'm working on personal project on Large Language Models now, so stay tuned for a new repo, coming soon, if you'd like to see how I code circa now 🚨.

⏮️ ⏰ If you'd like to rewind back to my earliest days of coding, you can check out my repos with my [master's thesis](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Investment_Advice_from_the_FOMC), which used NLP to predict financial market movements based on Federal Reserve meeting materials and [select projects](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects) I completed during my early career or in graduate school.
